# NativeScript React Example

This project is an example of **NativeScript** using **React**. This example was a practical exercise for challenging me to create an app with the following features:
- State handling
- **API** calls
- External assets support

## Setup

Install NativeScript CLI

```
npm install -g nativescript@next
```

Install the dependencies with the following command

```
npm install
```

## Run
We'll use **NativeScript Preview App)** (Download [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nativescript-preview/id1264484702) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.preview.android) version) for testing this app

For this we'll run the next command and then we can scan the QR code with our phone

```
ns preview
```
